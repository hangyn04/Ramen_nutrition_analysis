# Ramen nutrition analysis
* Ramen noodles are a popular and convenient food for many people, especially in Asian countries, offering a wide range of instant flavors such as seafood, chicken, and beef. However, the nutritional content of ramen often raises health concerns due to high levels of sodium, fat, and calories.
* As a ramen enthusiast myself, I decided to conduct a detailed analysis of various ramen products to gain deeper insights into their nutritional composition and explore healthier consumption patterns. By leveraging real-world data from the Nutritionix API, this analysis categorizes ramen based on key nutritional factors such as calories, sodium, fat, and protein per serving.
**NOTE**: Since each product comes with varied serving sizes, I transformed the data into a consistent measure per gram and added automated columns for calories, sodium, fat, and protein per gram to standardize the comparisons<br>
* The goal of this project is to help individuals, including myself, make informed decisions about which ramen products align with our health goals. By identifying products with balanced nutritional profiles and highlighting those with higher sodium or fat content, this analysis empowers consumers to choose wisely. The project employs Python for data retrieval, cleaning, and analysis, while insights are visualized through SQL queries and Power BI.
